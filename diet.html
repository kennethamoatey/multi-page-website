				The restaurant bar is like the fun-loving sidekick to the more orderly dining room. Whether guests are joining you for post-work cocktails or Sunday Night Football, you want to provide an appealing ambiance (along with great food and drinks). Your restaurant bar design can determine whether your customers will hang out for hours or leave after one quick drink.

					<p>The most abundant vitamins and minerals in strawberries are:
						Vitamin C. Strawberries are an excellent source of vitamin C, an antioxidant necessary for immune and skin health (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).
						Manganese. Frequently found in high amounts in whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables, this trace element is important for many processes in your body (9Trusted Source).
						Folate (vitamin B9). One of the B vitamins, folate is important for normal tissue growth and cell function — and fundamental for pregnant women and older adults (10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).
						Potassium. This mineral is involved in many essential body functions, such as regulating blood pressure (13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source).

						Fresh fruits are naturally sweet and pack huge nutritional benefits as well. Fruits act as cleansers for your body, give you energy and supply a vast array of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that promote good health.
						Adding fruit to your diet is as simple as eating an apple with your lunch or slicing a banana onto your breakfast cereal. Aim to add at least two or three servings to your daily diet to get the numerous benefits fruits have to offer.
						Fruit may also promote the healthy circulation of your blood, which also reduces your risk of heart disease. Willett adds that citrus fruits, such as oranges and grapefruit, may be particularly beneficial at reducing your risk of heart diseases.
